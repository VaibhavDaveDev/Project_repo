# Project Context Summary

This file summarizes the development process for the Mentor-Mentee application, including the backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) components.

## Project Goal

To build a Mentor-Mentee application with features for user authentication, profile management, course management, mentorship application, progress tracking, and meeting scheduling.

## Technologies Used

*   Frontend: React.js (with TypeScript)
*   Backend: FastAPI (Python)
*   Database: PostgreSQL (with SQLAlchemy ORM)
*   Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
*   UI Library: Material UI

## Current Status

The backend (FastAPI) development is mostly complete. All the necessary routers (auth, users, mentors, mentees, courses, mentorships, reports, meetings, skills, domains, admin) have been created and implemented.

The frontend (React) development has started. The basic project structure is set up, and the authentication flow (login, registration) is being implemented.

## Key Issues and Solutions

*   **ImportError:** Encountered `ImportError` due to relative imports. The solution was to switch to absolute imports (e.g., `from mentor_mentee_backend import models` instead of `from . import models`).
*   **"is not a module" Error:** Encountered "is not a module" error in React/TypeScript project, indicating missing export statements. The solution was to ensure that all necessary components are exported correctly.

## Next Steps

1.  Continue testing the authentication flow in the React frontend.
2.  Start building the dashboard components and integrating them with the backend API.
3.  Address any remaining `ImportError` issues by carefully checking the project structure and import statements.

## Important Notes

*   The project structure should be strictly adhered to.
*   Absolute imports are preferred over relative imports.
*   All necessary dependencies must be installed in the virtual environment.
*   The `SECRET_KEY` for JWT authentication should be stored securely in a production environment.

This summary will be updated as the project progresses.
